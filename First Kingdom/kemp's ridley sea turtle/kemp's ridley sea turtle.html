<hr class="my-4">
   <p> This turtle is commonly known as kemp’s ridley sea turtle and its scientific name is lepidochelys kempii.The kemp’s ridley sea         turtle is a reptile and it is an omnivore (eats both meat and plants), its size is 2 feet, it weighs about 45 kilograms, its upper     shell is a greyish-green colour, their bellies are off-white to yellowish and has a lifespan of 50 years.
       The kemp’s ridley sea turtle is the most endangered specie of turtle in the world.This is due to over-harvesting of their eggs and although their nesting grounds are protected and many commercial fishing ships now use turtle excluder devices in their nets, the turtles have not been able to repopulate very much.
       The turtles’ nesting processions is called arribadas and when it occurs, female kemp’s ridley sea turtles take over large areas of the beach and moving with their flippers in the sand until they find a suitable spot to lay the eggs.After around 55 days, hatchlings break out of their shells at night using a single temporary tooth grown only for this purpose.
       These turtles are mainly found in the Gulf of Mexico but can be found as far north Nova Scotia.They prefer to go to shallow waters to dive to the bottom to feast on their prey. Their diet consists of crabs (their favourite food), other shellfish, jellyfish, seaweed and sargassum (occasionally munched on).
       Their predators are known to snatch their eggs and they are foxes, weasels, raccoons, dogs and even humans.</p>
